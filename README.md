# 🚀 Nick Braver's Portfolio

> *Vibe-coded and launched with AntiGravity. Designed in Figma.*

Welcome to the code behind my personal portfolio! This isn't just a website; it's a conversation. 

## 🤖 What's Under the Hood?

This project flips the script on traditional portfolios. Instead of a static gallery, I built a **conversational interface** where you can chat with a "bot" version of me to explore my work.

### Key Features
- **💬 Chat Interface**: A fully interactive chat experience to navigate my background and projects.
- **↔️ Split-Screen Detail View**: Click on a project, and watch the magic happen. A detailed case study slides in, keeping the chat alive while you dive deep.
- **🎨 Premium Aesthetics**: Dark mode by default (because we have taste), glassmorphism, and buttery smooth animations.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Looks just as good on your phone as it does on your 4K monitor.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with love and a lot of coffee:
- **React**: For the UI logic.
- **Vite**: For lightning-fast builds.
- **CSS Modules**: For keeping styles clean and modular.
- **Google Sans Flex**: For that crisp, modern typography.
